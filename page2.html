<h4><center>Current Interests</center></h4>
<p><ul><li>As a current MA student, I decided to branch out from my years studying Latin American language and culture to step into European and more specifically British
literature as my research focus. I am fascinated by great classical authors such as Joseph Conrad, Mary Shelley, and Jane Austen to name a few. 
During my graduate career, I hope to read as many novels as possible and solidify my interests within a specific time period or genre of European/British literature.
For me, the study of cultural phenomenons like racism and sexism are easily accessible through the author's work, a reflective piece unconsciously sharing the attitudes of their time period.
The novel <i>Dubliners</i> by Joseph Conrad is the anthem of early twentieth century Irish cultural identity in which ragged living conditions and bleak future opportunities
shape and mold the character's individual lives in strikingly similar ways. These novels can be political manifestos or simply creative pieces, either way I am hoping to focus my studies
on the historical aspect of literature and stepping back into the past for information on how cultural patterns are still occuring today and how we can use literature to reach them.</ul></li></p>
